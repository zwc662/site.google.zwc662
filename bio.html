I am a Ph.D. student at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Boston University. Currently I'm working on AI safety problems under the supervision of  <a href="https://www.bu.edu/eng/profile/39799/">Wenchao Li</a> in <a href="http://sites.bu.edu/depend/">DEPENDABLE Lab</a> . Prior to this, I studied Microelectronics  and received M.S. and B.S. degree at Fudan Universtiy. I also spent one year as a full-time engineer in Micron, Inc.  Here is my <a href="zwc66@bu.edu">CV</a>.

I'm interested in the association between <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FMachine_learning&sa=D"> machine learning</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FMachine_learning&sa=D"> formal methods</a>.   Despite having been deployed in real-world systems, machine learning does not offer guarantees on the correctness of the systems. Whereas, formal methods provide safety assurance methodologies by offering mathematical proof to the verification of software/hardware systems . The application of formal methods in machine learning systems, such as deep neural networks, has emerged.  My researches are focused on reconciling those two areas both in deductive and inductive way.
